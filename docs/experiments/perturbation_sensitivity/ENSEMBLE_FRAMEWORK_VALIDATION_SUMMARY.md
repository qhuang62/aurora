## Critical Discovery: Weather Jiu-Jitsu Discrepancy

### Previous Finding vs New Results:

**Weather Jiu-Jitsu Baseline:**
- 80 m/s wind perturbations â†’ only 6 km track deviation
- Conclusion: Aurora too stable for ensemble applications

**New Sensitivity Analysis:**
- 0.5 m/s wind perturbations â†’ 24 km track deviation  
- 2.0 m/s wind perturbations â†’ 28 km track deviation
- 10.0 m/s wind perturbations â†’ 332 km track deviation

### Hypothesis: Non-linear Sensitivity Response
Aurora may exhibit **saturation behavior** where:
1. **Realistic perturbations (0.1-10 units)**: High sensitivity, excellent response
2. **Extreme perturbations (>50 units)**: Saturated response, minimal additional effect

**Recommendation**: Investigate sensitivity curve characteristics in future studies.
